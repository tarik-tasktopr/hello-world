You do not need to edit the existing code. It is already set up to serve the necessary files when requested by the browser. Just make sure that the files "index.html", "style.css", and "script.js" are located in the same directory as the "server.js" file and that their names are spelled correctly. When the server is running, you can access the website by navigating to "http://localhost:3000" in your web browser.
